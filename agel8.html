<P>Internet is not just a need or luxury, it has become a household necessity.
 Internet connects you with your friends, and family, and access the top courses without moving geographically.
 Internet was used as a source of entertainment but now it is impossible to work in offices or study without the internet.
 When the global pandemic locked everyone in their house, it became an important medium to connect, study and work.
 Students were able to study without the risk of catching covid-19 because of the Internet.
 The importance of the internet is also a common topic in various entrance exams 
such as SAT, TOEFL, and UPSC. The last few years have witnessed heavy reliance on the internet. 
This has been because of multiple advantages that it has to offer – for instance reducing work stress and changing
 the face of communication most importantly.
 If we take the current scenario, we cannot ignore how important the Internet is in our everyday lives.
 It is now indeed a challenging task to visualize a world without the internet.
 One may define the internet as a large library composed of stuff like – records, pictures, websites, and pieces of information
. Another sector in which the internet has an undeniably important role to play is in the field of communication.
 Without access to the internet, the ability to share thoughts and ideas across the globe would have also been just a dream. </p>
